NLP-Cloud-With-OOPs — README (proposed)
Below is a ready-to-use, well-structured README.md you can copy into your repository.
It documents the project, setup, usage, security notes and suggested improvements — including a small secure code snippet to replace the hard-coded API key.

NLP-Cloud-With-OOPs

Simple CLI NLP application written with an OOP style that demonstrates basic user registration/login and calls NLP Cloud for NER.

NOTE: This repo uses nlpcloud — you must supply your own NLP Cloud API key.

About
A small object-oriented Python CLI application (app.py) that lets users register/login, then run NLP tasks (NER currently implemented). The app calls NLP Cloud model endpoints to perform the tasks.

The current app provides:

User registration & login (in-memory database)

NER via NLP Cloud (using nlpcloud.Client)

Menu-driven CLI

Parts still TODO (can be implemented the same way):

Language detection

Sentiment analysis

Persistent storage for users

Better authentication

Features
OOP-based simple CLI interface

Demonstrates calling a cloud NLP API (NLP Cloud)

Quick prototype for NLP-powered apps

Requirements
Python 3.10 or later (recommended to use a virtual environment)

nlpcloud Python package

Example requirements.txt (save to project root):

shell
Copy
Edit
nlpcloud>=1.1
(You may add other packages you use later.)

Installation
(Optional but recommended) create and activate a virtual environment:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # macOS / Linux
# or on Windows:
# .\venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
# or directly:
pip install nlpcloud
Ensure your app.py (or the code you run) is using the correct Python interpreter (if using VS Code select the virtualenv interpreter).

Configuration (API key)
Important: Do not hard-code your API key into source files. Instead export it as an environment variable and load it in code.

Example (macOS / Linux):

bash
Copy
Edit
export NLPCLOUD_API_KEY="your_real_api_key_here"
export NLPCLOUD_MODEL="finetuned-gpt-neox-20b"   # or whichever model you use
Windows PowerShell:

powershell
Copy
Edit
$env:NLPCLOUD_API_KEY="your_real_api_key_here"
$env:NLPCLOUD_MODEL="finetuned-gpt-neox-20b"
Replace hard-coded API key (recommended code snippet)
In app.py, replace this:

python
Copy
Edit
client = nlpcloud.Client("finetuned-gpt-neox-20b", "523ad8e8b84573d26d033e11620af7012add3b9c", gpu=True, lang="en")
with a secure approach:

python
Copy
Edit
import os
import nlpcloud

API_KEY = os.getenv("NLPCLOUD_API_KEY")
MODEL = os.getenv("NLPCLOUD_MODEL", "finetuned-gpt-neox-20b")

if not API_KEY:
    raise RuntimeError("Please set the NLPCLOUD_API_KEY environment variable.")

client = nlpcloud.Client(MODEL, API_KEY, gpu=True, lang="en")
This way you never commit secrets to Git.

Usage
Run the app from the project root:

bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
You’ll see the interactive menu:

css
Copy
Edit
Hi! How would you like to proceed?
1. Not a member? Register
2. Already a member? Login
3. Quit
Register with an email and password (stored in memory only).

Login to access the second menu and choose NER, Language Detection or Sentiment Analysis (NER currently implemented).

Example session (NER)
Choose 2 → Login (enter the registered email/password).

Choose 1 → NER.

You’ll be prompted:

sql
Copy
Edit
enter the paragraph:
what would you like to search:
The app sends the paragraph and search entity to the NLP Cloud entities endpoint and prints the response.

Security & Improvements (recommended)
These are important improvements to make the app production-ready or more robust:

Never store secrets in code — use environment variables or a secrets manager.

Do not store passwords in plain text; use hashing (e.g., bcrypt) and store hashed passwords (or better: use a DB).

Implement persistent storage — use a file-based DB (sqlite) or a proper database instead of an in-memory dict.

Add error handling around network calls to NLP Cloud and timeouts.

Write unit tests for registration/login and NLP wrapper functions.

Implement language detection and sentiment using NLP Cloud endpoints.

Improve CLI UX — loop the menus so the program doesn't exit after each action; add input validation.

Add logging (do not log secrets).

Add a .gitignore for venv/, .env, __pycache__/ etc.

Suggested .gitignore:

bash
Copy
Edit
venv/
.env
__pycache__/
.ipynb_checkpoints
*.pyc
*.log

Contributing
Create issues for bugs or feature requests.

Open pull requests — please include tests if adding features.

Follow the coding style (PEP8) and add a short description in PRs.

Troubleshooting
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'nlpcloud' → Make sure you installed dependencies and that your runner (local VS Code, GitHub Actions) installs requirements.txt.

GitHub Actions failing → ensure requirements.txt is committed and the workflow includes an Install dependencies step that installs pip install -r requirements.txt (or specific pip installs).

API key error → ensure NLPCLOUD_API_KEY is exported before running or set in the CI secrets.
